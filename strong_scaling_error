mpirun detected that one or more processes exited with non-zero status, thus causing
the job to be terminated. The first process to do so was:

  Process name: [[31727,1],593]
  Exit code:    1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 28422 ON lc02 CANCELLED AT 2025-04-22T00:59:07 DUE TO TIME LIMIT ***

ORTE has lost communication with a remote daemon.

  HNP daemon   : [[30564,0],0] on node lc02
  Remote daemon: [[30564,0],25] on node lc27

This is usually due to either a failure of the TCP network
connection to the node, or possibly an internal failure of
the daemon itself. We cannot recover from this failure, and
therefore will terminate the job.
