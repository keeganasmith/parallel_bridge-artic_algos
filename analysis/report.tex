\begin{abstract}
Bridges have important applications in areas like networking, cybersecurity, and biological sciences. In this paper we propose a parallel bridge-finding algorithm which leverages union-find. Our implementation scales to at least 192 cores on a single node.

\section{Introduction}
Graphs are used in many fields of science to model systems, thus being able to analyze these graphs quickly and efficiently is important. \\
In this paper we propose a parallel algorithm for finding bridges in a graph which we show scales to hundreds of cores. \\
To the best of our knowledge, no other works have shown evidence of a scalable parallel bridge finding algorithm.
\section{Related Work}
The world of parallel bridge algorithms is somewhat sparse. Kumar and Singh ~\cite{kumar2021efficient} proposed a parallel bridge finding algorithm focused on DFS, however their implementation only seemed to scale up to 50 cores.
\section{Methodology}
Our algorithm leverages the fact that a bridge must be present in every spanning tree of a graph. Thus, if an edge is not present in any given spanning tree of a graph, then the edge must be
